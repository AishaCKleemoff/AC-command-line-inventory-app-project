# Aisha Kleemoff's Command Line Inventory App Project 

 Bringing together all we've learned so far, about JavaScript and building applications,I'll build a Command-line Inventory Application. It will be an application where employees can keep track of the hair bundle inventory of a store. Employees can create new bundles, update existing bundles, see a list of bundles, see details of one bundle and delete bundles.
