# Aisha Kleemoff's Command Line Inventory App Project 

## Bringing together all we've learned so far, about JavaScript and building applications,I'll build a Command-line Inventory Application. It will be an application where employees can keep track of the inventory of a store. Employees can create new items, update items, see a list of items, see details of one item and delete items.
